        Like most businesses, Picasso holds and processes a range of information about its clients, customers, sellers, vendors, and other persons who may be interested in Picasso services.
        This Privacy Policy applies to Picasso globally and explains the type of information that we process, why we are processing it and how that processing may affect you.  
        The Privacy Policy is split into the sections listed below.  The Glossary section explains what we mean by “personal data,” “processing,” and other terms used in this notice.
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time and will post any revised notice on this webpage.  Where appropriate, we may notify you by email or by a notice on our website that our privacy notice has changed, but we recommend that you check this page regularly.  Any changes will be immediately effective on posting.

        <div className="privacy-text2">Who we are ?</div><br></br>
        <div className="privacy-text3">
        Picasso Auction House Private Limited ("Picasso" or "Company") is a Company registered under the Companies Act, 2013 in India.
        When you buy and sell in our auctions or by private sale or purchase other services or goods from us, or when you take part in one of our events or attend a course or lecture in person, the controller of your data will be the Company. 
        </div><br></br><br></br>
        <div className="privacy-text2">How and when do we collect your personal data ?</div><br></br>
        <div className="privacy-text4">Collection directly from you in response to our request</div><br></br>
        <div className="privacy-text3">Personal information is information, or a combination of pieces of information, that could reasonably allow you to be identified. As described in more detail below, we collect personal information about you from a variety of sources, including information we collect from you directly, information we collect about you from other sources, and information we collect automatically from you.
        We collect information that you submit to us or provide to us on forms available on third party websites. The types of information that we collect directly from you include: personal details (e.g., name, date of birth, alias and/or avatar alias), contact details (e.g., phone number, email address, postal address), transaction information (e.g., bidding or purchase records, shipping details, information about items you purchase or wish to consign), details about your collection, limited financial information (e.g., tokenized payment information in connection with your purchases, wire instructions, digital wallet details and address), username and password, user ID, unique device ID, information on forms required for certain transactions (e.g PAN, AADHAAR number, etc.), and identification information (e.g. photo ID).<br></br><br></br>
        We rely on the information you provide to us or that we collect or observe about your individual interactions with us, for example, if you attend a live event, agree to sell or consign property, participate in one of our auctions, become a client, register or bid online.<br></br>
        We may use common data collection technologies as you visit our websites or apps or interact with our emails.<br></br><br></br>
        For example: Our logs gather date, time, information about your browser and system or device configuration, information about how you interact with our digital properties, and an IP address for all visitors to our sites.
        If you have registered with us online, we use data collection technologies to collect information that indicates your individual interests in our websites, online platforms and apps, and your response to our emails and marketing campaigns.
        The Cookies and similar technologies on our digital platforms can also read and collect data about your browsers as you visit and interact with those platforms: please read our Cookie Policy for more detailed information about what cookies are, what kinds are used on our sites, and what choices you have. As described further in our Cookie Policy, we use these technologies to enable you to use our digital platforms, learn how you and others interact with our digital platforms, personalize the content on our digital platforms, and to deliver advertising based on your interests, including those inferred from your activities over time and across digital platforms operated by us and others.<br></br><br></br>
        In general, our app will communicate data you provide about yourself, for example, registration, purchase, or bidding data, to our databases and systems. An app may, however, rely on other data collection technologies to recognize the device you use for viewing and to personalize your experience. If our app relies on additional data collection technologies that collect or use data about individual users, we will include additional notice either within the app or in a policy that accompanies it.
        We also use and allow certain other companies to use technologies that are similar to cookies (for example pixels and gifs) when we send you emails.
        </div><br></br><br></br>
        <div className="privacy-text4">Automatic collection of data may take place when you telephone bid, call Client Relations, visit our premises or our website or attend any event conducted, hosted and/or sponsored by Picasso.</div><br></br>
        <div className="privacy-text3">Your voice will be recorded when you call our Client Relations team, and when you use our telephone bidding service.
        Your image may be collected by Picasso if you attend our premises. We use CCTV at our premises and offices for the protection of our staff, our visitors and the property that we sell. We video our auctions for security reasons and to monitor bidding practices. Cameras and microphones recording images and sound for any events focus primarily on the auctioneer/presenters and Picasso specialists, but background sound and images may also be captured. Attendees should inform AstaGuru in advance if they do not wish to be filmed/recorded. However, the only remedy available in certain situations, if you do not wish to be filmed/recorded would be to remain absent from that particular event.
        </div><br></br>
        <div className="privacy-text4">What personal data do we process and why?</div><br></br>
        <div className="privacy-text3">We have set out below the types of personal data that we process, the purposes for which we use it and the legal grounds on which we process it.  The Glossary contains more information about the legal grounds for processing.Purpose
        To provide you with requested services
        (for example, bidding, selling, valuations, storage, shipping, loans and loan referral, catalogue subscription, restoration, expertise)<br></br>
        Examples of personal data
        (Please note that the list is not exhaustive)
        name, title, and contact details (including email address, postal address, telephone numbers)
        your bank account details (if we need to pay you) or payment card details or bank transfer receipt (if you need to pay us)
        the person or organisation who has introduced you, and any fee they receive
        details of the property to which the services relate
        nature of the services including contractual terms
        details of your insurance if your property remains at your risk
        financial information
        records of your communications with us (including bidding instructions recorded over the telephone or online bidding logs)</div><br></br>
        <div className="privacy-text4">Who gets to see your personal data?</div><br></br>
        <div className="privacy-text3">We do not transfer your personal data to organisations who wish to use it for their own marketing promotions or other purposes.  Your personal data will only be shared with other organisations where it is necessary to enable us to provide you with the services you have requested (for example: we may transfer your data to our bank, payment card acquirers, shippers, warehouses, insurers, experts who help us authenticate or value property, companies that perform identification, anti-fraud and credit checks or screening for sanctions, anti-money laundering and/or negative media purposes, event venues, caterers, catalogue and direct marketing fulfilment and distribution).  Where we do so it will be on the basis that these organisations are required to keep the information confidential and secure, and they will only use the information to carry out the instructed services.
        Some of these organisations may be located in a different country to the one where your personal data was collected.
        We may need to retain and disclose certain information about you to appropriate agencies to conduct anti-money laundering and trade sanction checks, to assist with fraud and crime prevention and detection and to meet our health and safety obligations. We may also need to disclose this information to our banks, insurers or auditors for the purposes of evidencing Picasso compliance with anti-money laundering, sanctions and other relevant regulations, or to enable the bank, insurer or other regulated firm to complete its own due diligence in connection with you or your transactions.
        If law enforcement or other entities, bodies or persons request disclosure of your personal data (such as your contact details or information about purchases), we will only disclose data if we are satisfied after internal review that we are legally required to do so or that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or the rights of others and is not prohibited by law.</div><br></br>
        <div className="privacy-text4">Is your personal data transferred internationally?</div><br></br>
        <div className="privacy-text3">As an organisation that conducts transactions with entities globally, AstaGuru may in the normal course of its business transfer your personal data internationally to any entities who may need to process your data in connection with the services that AstaGuru provides to you. AstaGuru uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) for its servers, and the location of the servers is dependent on AWS.</div><br></br>
        <div className="privacy-text4">How long will we keep your personal data?</div><br></br>
        <div className="privacy-text3">We will retain your personal data for as long as is necessary to provide the relevant services, maintain business records to satisfy tax, legal and other regulatory requirements, and protect and defend against potential legal claims.
        In the context of our research and records on ownership of art objects to assist with checks on authenticity, provenance and title, we will keep this data for as long as the record is relevant to our legitimate business interests and the public interest. Please be aware that we do not remove or amend property titles or provenance information once published. Picasso catalogues and lot pages are important resources for public research, market transparency and, where relevant, supporting object value and, as such, we consider that it is in the interests of sellers and buyers and the public more generally for the published provenance of a property to remain available online to the public indefinitely. We take this approach unless required otherwise by applicable law.</div><br></br>
        <div className="privacy-text4">How do we keep your personal data secure? </div><br></br>
        <div className="privacy-text3">We understand that your personal information is important, and we are committed to treating it with the utmost care and security.
        We have multiple layers of security technologies and controls in our environment which safeguard your data, while at rest or in transit, from unauthorised access or disclosure. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. In addition, our colleagues receive data protection training, and we have in place detailed security and data protection policies which colleagues are required to follow when handling personal information. 
        In an ever-altering threat landscape, we are constantly assessing our security defences to ensure your data continues to stay protected. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
        </div><br></br>
        <div className="privacy-text4">Third party websites</div><br></br>
        <div className="privacy-text3">Picasso Digital Platforms may contain links to other websites not operated by AstaGuru. The information you provide to us will not be transmitted to other websites, but these other websites may collect personal information about you in accordance with their own privacy notice. AstaGuru cannot accept any responsibility for the privacy practices or content of those websites.</div><br></br>
        <div className="privacy-text4"> Access to your data and other rights</div><br></br>
        <div className="privacy-text3">You may ask us if you have questions about the data we hold on you. Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. These include:
        The right of access: You may request a copy of the personal data that we hold about you (a “subject access request”).  If you exercise this right and we process personal data about you by automated means or as part of a filing system, once we have verified your identity and, if relevant, the authority of any third-party requestor, we are required to provide you with a description and copy of that personal data and tell you why we are processing it.
        Other rights
        As well as your subject access right, you may have a legal right to have some or all of your personal data rectified or erased, to object to its processing, or have its processing restricted.
        If you have provided us with data about yourself and the ground for processing is Contract or Consent, you may have the right to be given the data in machine readable format for transmitting to another data controller.
        If we are relying on Consent as the grounds for processing your data, you may withdraw consent at any time. This will not affect the lawfulness of Picasso processing of your data prior to your withdrawal.</div><br></br><br></br><br></br><br></br><br></br>
